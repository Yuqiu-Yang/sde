So you say you are interested in stochastic differential equations? And you also subscribe to the idea of learning by example? Well, you are in luck!
<b>sde</b> provides basic tools for simulating brownian motions which is the basic ingredients to lots of SDE models, performing different types of stochastic integrations, Eular-Maruyama methods and so much more (to come...). 

The origin of this project is this wonderful introductory [paper](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/S0036144500378302) by Desmond J. Higham.
